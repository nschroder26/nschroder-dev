At the time of writing this Iâ€™ve setup a login through Firebase, and have setup state to handle some very basic rendering if the user is logged in. In the end, the goal is to allow a user to login and view any recent photos that have been added. As well as to be able to search by a variety of different tags, and to save or favorite different photos.",
